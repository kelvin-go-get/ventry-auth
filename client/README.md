# Ventry - Project Setup Guide

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This guide will help you run the project locally, even if you don't have coding experience.

## Project Overview

This project has two parts:

- **Client (Frontend)**: Built using Next.js and TypeScript
- **Server (Backend)**: Built using Node.js with TypeScript

We also use:

- PostgreSQL database (managed with pgAdmin 7)

---

## 1. Requirements

Please install the following before starting:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or above)
- [PostgreSQL + pgAdmin 7](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

---

## 2. Project Structure

/ventry
â”œâ”€â”€ /client # Frontend (Next.js)
â””â”€â”€ /server # Backend (Node.js + Express)

Each folder has its own environment (`.env`) file you need to create.

---

## 3. Setting Up PostgreSQL

1. Open pgAdmin 7
2. Create a new Database called: `ventry`
3. Set up a User with these credentials:
   - Username: `postgres`
   - Password: `9046`
4. Make sure port `5432` is open (default for PostgreSQL)

---

## 4. Setting up Backend (Server)

1. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt
2. Navigate to the server folder:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

Install the dependencies:
npm install

```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder with the following content:
```

DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=9046
DB_NAME=ventry
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
JWT_SECRET=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsImVtYWlsIjoidXNlckBleGFtcGxlLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTU4ODY3NywiZXhwIjoxNzQ1NTkyMjc3fQ.pU-S8sjjZmNZ7G-OdZnMlBI13T4OBlJwn_DOcYvhaTo
INVITE_ONLY=true
JWT_EXPIRATION=1h

````
4. Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
````

5. The server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`
6. If you see any errors, please check the console for details.

## 5. Setting up Frontend (Client)

1. Open a new Terminal or Command Prompt
2. Navigate to the client folder:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the `client` folder with the following content:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```
5. Start the client:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
6. The client should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`
7. If you see any errors, please check the console for details.

---

## 6. Accessing the Application

- Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
- You should see the Ventry application running.
- If you encounter any issues, please check the console for errors and ensure both the client and server are running.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, please check the console for errors and ensure both the client and server are running.
- Make sure PostgreSQL is running and the database is set up correctly.
- If you have any questions or need help, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.

# Testing the project

- You can test registration and login with sample requests using a REST client (like Thunder Client for VSCode) or Postman.
- Here are some sample requests you can use:

### Registration

```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "testuser@example.com",
  "password": "testpassword"
}
```

### Login

```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "testuser@example.com",
  "password": "testpassword"
}
```

# ðŸŽ‰ That's it!

- If you follow the steps carefully, the app should be running on your computer!
